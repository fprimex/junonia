# Junonia

[A snail with a beautiful shell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphella_junonia) Wherein I try to solve, at least for myself, several common shell scripting challenges in an extremely portable way.

Document your shell script in Markdown and get an argument parser for free. More to come.

See the [examples](examples) directory to see how you can use Junonia to parse arguments from either a program argument spec defined in a tree-like format, or from Markdown documentation for each command.
